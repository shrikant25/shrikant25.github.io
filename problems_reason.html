  <h1>Why problems persists.</h1><br><br>
  <h2>
    <p>
        Most of the time people don't want solution. They just want to cry about the problem.<br>
        Sometimes people just don't care about solving the problem or they don't even realise the actual problem. <br>
        Most obvious solutions are deemed crazy and get laughed upon.<br>
        People in general are lazy and give up easily.<br>
        People are afraid to do something new or do something that others are not doing. <br>
        People often don't ask around, read about or search on internet for solutions. <br>
        Most of the time it is difficult for people to digest the easy solutions or acknowledge their incompetence. <br>

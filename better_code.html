  <h1>Things to make your code better.</h1><br><br>
  <h2>
    <p>
       NEVER ASSUME ANYTHING, ALWAYS BE SKEPTICAL, QUESTION EVERYTHING.
       <br>
       <br>
       Write down the problem. <br>
       Think about the problem. <br>
       Think of all edge cases. <br>
       Write the solution. Think of all the use cases. Think of all the ways it can go wrong. <br>
       Make it as generic/decoupled as possible, although in some cases solution may have to be interrelated and specific. <br>
       Read the necessary documentation (if any). <br>
       Check the return values of functions. Based on return values determine if it was exepceted value or error. <br>
       Keep extensive logging of errors, specific values, actions and decisions that are being made in the code. <br>
       Good error handling and logging will save hours of debugging.<br>
       While debugging, go through logs, observe the gaps and try to identify where things went wrong. <br>
       Write extensive test cases. It doesn't matter if test cases grow larger than original code. Keep running test cases even after small changes. <br>
       Always write code keeping in mind that someone else has to read and work on your code in future. <br>
       Every now and then read code of open source projects in order to get newer ideas. <br>
       Try to read code written in different languages, because different languages force to think differently. <br>
       Always work on side projects. <br>
       Doing all of above mentioned things is mentally energy consuming, also you might have to work little bit longer, but it is worth the pain.<br>
